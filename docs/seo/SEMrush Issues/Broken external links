About this issue: Broken external links lead users from one website to another and bring them to non-existent webpages. Multiple broken links negatively affect user experience and may worsen your search engine rankings because crawlers may think that your website is poorly maintained or coded. Please note that our crawler may detect a working link as broken. Generally, this happens if the server hosting the website you're referring to blocks our crawler from accessing this website. How to fix: Please follow all links reported as broken. If a target webpage returns an error, remove the link leading to the error page or replace it with another resource. If the links reported as broken do work when accessed with a browser, you should contact the website's owner and inform them about the issue.
