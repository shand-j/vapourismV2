About this issue: Our crawler reports pages that have duplicate meta descriptions only if they are exact matches. A <meta description> tag is a short summary of a webpage's content that helps search engines understand what the page is about and can be shown to users in search results. Duplicate meta descriptions on different pages mean a lost opportunity to use more relevant keywords. Also, duplicate meta descriptions make it difficult for search engines and users to differentiate between different webpages. It is better to have no meta description at all than to have a duplicate one. How to fix: Provide a unique, relevant meta description for each of your webpages. For information on how to create effective meta descriptions, please see this Google article: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35624
