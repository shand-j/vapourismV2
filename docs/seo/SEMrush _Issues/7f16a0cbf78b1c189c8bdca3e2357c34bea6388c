About this issue: This issue is triggered if structured data items contain fields that do not meet Google's guidelines https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/article. Implementing and maintaining your structured data correctly is important if you want to get an edge over your competitors in search results. If your website markup has errors, crawlers will not be able to properly understand it, and you may run the risk of losing the chance of gaining rich snippets and getting more favorable rankings. For more information on the structured data requirements, see https://schema.org, Google documentation https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/article or our article https://www.semrush.com/kb/1084-structured-data-items-site-audit. How to fix: Check structured data on your webpages with a validation tool. Please note that different markup testing tools may show different results. We recommend that you use the Rich Results Test tool https://search.google.com/test/rich-results to review and validate your pages’ structured data against their rich snippet requirements.
