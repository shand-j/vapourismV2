About this issue: Our crawler reports pages that have duplicate title tags only if they are exact matches. Duplicate <title> tags make it difficult for search engines to determine which of a website’s pages is relevant for a specific search query, and which one should be prioritized in search results. Pages with duplicate titles have a lower chance of ranking well and are at risk of being banned. Moreover, identical <title> tags confuse users as to which webpage they should follow. How to fix: Provide a unique and concise title for each of your pages that contains your most important keywords. For information on how to create effective titles, please see this Google article: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35624

About this issue: Redirecting one URL to another is appropriate in many situations. However, if redirects are done incorrectly, it can lead to disastrous results. Two common examples of improper redirect usage are redirect chains and loops. Long redirect chains and infinite loops lead to a number of problems that can damage your SEO efforts. They make it difficult for search engines to crawl your site, which affects your crawl budget usage and how well your webpages are indexed, slows down your site's load speed, and, as a result, may have a negative impact on your rankings and user experience. Please note that if you can’t spot a redirect chain with your browser, but it is reported in your Site Audit report, your website probably responds to crawlers’ and browsers’ requests differently, and you still need to fix the issue. How to fix: The best way to avoid any issues is to follow one general rule: do not use more than three redirects in a chain. If you are already experiencing issues with long redirect chains or loops, we recommend that you redirect each URL in the chain to your final destination page. We do not recommend that you simply remove redirects for intermediate pages as there can be other links pointing to your removed URLs, and, as a result, you may end up with 404 errors.
