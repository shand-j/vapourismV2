About this issue: Your text to HTML ratio indicates the amount of actual text you have on your webpage compared to the amount of code. This issue is triggered when your text to HTML is 10% or less. Search engines have begun focusing on pages that contain more content. That's why a higher text to HTML ratio means your page has a better chance of getting a good position in search results. Less code increases your page's load speed and also helps your rankings. It also helps search engine robots crawl your website faster. How to fix: Split your webpage's text content and code into separate files and compare their size. If the size of your code file exceeds the size of the text file, review your page's HTML code and consider optimizing its structure and removing embedded scripts and styles.
