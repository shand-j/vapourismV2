About this issue: Page (HTML) load speed is one of the most important ranking factors. The quicker your page loads, the higher the rankings it can receive. Moreover, fast-loading pages positively affect user experience and may increase your conversion rates. Please note that "page load speed" usually refers to the amount of time it takes for a webpage to be fully rendered by a browser. However, crawler only measures the time it takes to load a webpage’s HTML code - load times for images, JavaScript and CSS are not factored in. How to fix: The main factors that negatively affect your HTML page generation time are your server’s performance and the density of your webpage’s HTML code. So, try to clean up your webpage’s HTML code. If the problem is with your web server, you should think about moving to a better hosting service with more resources.
