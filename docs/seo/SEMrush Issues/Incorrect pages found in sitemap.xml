About this issue: A sitemap.xml file makes it easier for crawlers to discover the pages on your website. Only good pages intended for your visitors should be included in your sitemap.xml file. This error is triggered if your sitemap.xml contains URLs that: 1. lead to webpages with the same content. 2. redirect to a different webpage. 3. return non-200 status code. Populating your file with such URLs will confuse search engines, cause unnecessary crawling or may even result in your sitemap being rejected. How to fix: Review your sitemap.xml for any redirected, non-canonical or non-200 URLs. Provide the final destination URLs that are canonical and return a 200 status code.
