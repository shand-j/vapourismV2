About this issue: Having few incoming internal links means little to no visits or chances of being placed in search results. AI search engines use internal linking patterns to understand content importance and relationships within your site's knowledge network. Pages with few internal links may look less authoritative to AI algorithms and reduce your content's visibility and citation potential. How to fix: Add more incoming internal links to pages with important content.
